1
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:56,733
<i>I hope you don't mind me
taking the liberty.</i>

2
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,032
<i>I was careful
not to drag in any dirt.</i>

3
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:07,660
I don't mind the dirt.

4
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:10,830
I do mind

5
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:13,875
unannounced visits.

6
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:18,588
You police?

7
00:06:20,757 --> 00:06:25,386
Are you Sapper Morton?
Civic number NK68514?

8
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,637
I'm a farmer.

9
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:28,514
<i>I saw that.</i>

10
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:31,059
What do you farm?

11
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:40,234
It's a protein farm.

12
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,320
Wallace design.

13
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:45,948
Is that what I smell?

14
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:48,493
Grow that just for me.

15
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:50,953
Garlic.

16
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,330
Garlic.

17
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,290
Go on, try some.

18
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,043
No, thank you.

19
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,922
I prefer to keep
an empty stomach

20
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:02,924
until the hard part
of the day is done.

21
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:07,553
How long you been here?

22
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:09,472
Since 2020.

23
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,809
But you haven't always
been a farmer, have you?

24
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:16,521
<i>Your bag.</i>

25
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:18,773
<i>It's colonial medical use.</i>

26
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,067
Military issue.

27
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:26,239
<i>Where were you? Calantha?</i>

28
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:31,953
Must have been brutal.

29
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:34,497
Plan on taking me in?

30
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:39,252
Let them take a look inside?

31
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:41,170
Mr. Morton,

32
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,423
if taking you in
is an option,

33
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,514
<i>I would much prefer that
to the alternative.</i>

34
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:55,560
<i>I'm sure you knew
it would be someone in time.</i>

35
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,856
I'm sorry it had to be me.

36
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:05,528
Good as any.

37
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:11,659
<i>Now, if you don't mind,</i>

38
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:15,955
if you could just look up
and to the left, please.

39
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:15,556
Please don't get up.

40
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:29,111
How's it feel
killing your own kind?

41
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:35,826
I don't retire my own kind
because we don't run.

42
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:39,580
Only older models do.

43
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:44,585
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit,

44
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:51,425
because you've never seen
a miracle.

45
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,969
Just photograph everything.

46
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:48,607
Madam, please.

49
00:10:58,659 --> 00:10:59,910

52

53

00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:42,930
<i>I'll send a dig team.</i>

60
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,392

Honey, it's beautiful.

Relax.

141
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,425

It was a day.

143
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:58,889
Would you read to me?

144
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:02,017
It'll make you feel better.

145
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,187
- You hate that book.
- I don't wanna read either.

146
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:09,024
Let's dance.

147
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,610
Do you wanna dance, or do you
wanna open your present?

148
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:12,778
What present?

149
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:18,325
This one.

150
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:19,618
What's the occasion?

151
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:21,995
Let's just say

152
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,082
- it's our anniversary.
- Is it?

153
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:31,046
No, but let's just say
that it is.

154
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,923
Okay?

155
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,095
Happy anniversary.

156
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,223
An emanator.

157
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:25,517
Thank you.

158
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:29,396
Honey, you can go anywhere
you want in the world now.

159
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,399
Where do you wanna go first?

160
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:49,119
I'm so happy
when I'm with you.

161
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:52,956
You don't have to say that.

162
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,908
<i>The dig's come through.
We have a new lead.</i>

163
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:29,618
<i>Get down here.</i>

164
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,511
<i>Carbon read: 14. 6 GPH.</i>

165
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,908
<i>Your box
is a military footlocker</i>

166
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:12,202
<i>issued to Sapper Morton,</i>

167
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:15,080
<i>creatively repurposed
as an ossuary:</i>

168
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,790
<i>a box of bones.</i>

169
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:19,000
<i>Nothin' else in it but hair.</i>

170
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:22,546
<i>The soil samples indicate that</i>

171
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:24,589
<i>she's been buried
for 30 years.</i>

172
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:28,093
Bones all dismantled,
fully cleaned,

173
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:29,636
meticulously laid to rest.

174
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:31,096
"She"?

175
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:33,807
Cause of death, Coco?

176
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:48,738
No breaks,
no sign of trauma, except

177
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,867
a fracture
through the ilium.

178
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:55,579
It's a narrow birth canal.
Baby must have got stuck.

179
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,331
- She was pregnant?
- Hmm.

180
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:00,458
So he didn't kill her?

181
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,002
Mmm. She died in childbirth.

182
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:05,463
What's that?

183
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:08,300
<i>Go back.</i>

184
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:10,635
<i>Closer.</i>

185
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:13,555
<i>Closer.</i>

186
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:17,809
What's that?

187
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:21,021
Huh.

188
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:24,482
Notching in the iliac crest.

189
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:28,528
<i>It's fine-point,
like a scalpel.</i>

190
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:31,865
That looks like
an emergency C-section.

191
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:35,577
<i>The cuts are clean.
No sign of a struggle.</i>

192
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:38,371
He was a combat medic.

193
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,416
Maybe he tried to save her
and he just couldn't.

194
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,668
He didn't seem like
the saving type.

195
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:45,962
He went to the trouble
of burying her.

196
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,006
A sentimental skin-job.

197
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:52,010
Sorry.

198
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:53,845
So where's the kid?

199
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:57,307
You scan the whole field?

200
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:59,017
<i>Just dirt and worms.</i>

201
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,143
<i>No other bodies.</i>

202
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:01,895
Maybe he ate it.

203
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:52,862
<i>That's not possible.</i>

204
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:57,075
<i>She was a Replicant.</i>

205
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:00,996
Pregnant.

206
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:13,133
The world is built on a wall.

207
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:15,218
It separates kind.

208
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,596
Tell either side
there's no wall,

209
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,723
you bought a war.

210
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,183
Or a slaughter.

211
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:27,772
So, what you saw

212
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:31,609
didn't happen.

213
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:34,988
Yes, madam.

214
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:38,033
It is my job to keep order.

215
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,744
That's what we do here.
We keep order.

216
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,247
You want it gone?

217
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,751
Erase everything.

218
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:49,210
Even the child?

219
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:50,378
All trace.

220
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,718
<i>You have anything more to say?</i>

221
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:01,389
I've never retired something
that was born before.

222
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:04,059
<i>What's the difference?</i>

223
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,899
To be born is to have a soul,
I guess.

224
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:13,610
Are you telling me no?

225
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,197
I wasn't aware
that was an option, madam.

226
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:18,865
Attaboy.

227
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:23,495
Hey.

228
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:26,081
<i>You've been getting on fine
without one.</i>

229
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:27,749
What's that, madam?

230
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,626
A soul.

231
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:21,428
<i>And you new models
are happy scraping the shit</i>

232
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,391
<i>because you've never seen
a miracle.</i>

233
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:52,876
Just checking in
on an old serial number.

234
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,549
Confirmation DNA?

235
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:02,260
I got hair.

236
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:22,489
Oh! An old one.

237
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,950
Pre-Blackout. Huh.

238
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:28,328
That's gonna be tough.

239
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:31,664
Not much from then.

240
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,875
And what's there is

241
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:35,460
thick milky.

242
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:39,464
<i>You can customize them
as much as you'd like.</i>

243
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:41,883
<i>As human
as you want them to be.</i>

244
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:45,929
<i>But your operation is strictly
a drill site, isn't it?</i>

245
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:48,556
<i>I wouldn't waste your money
on intelligence,</i>

246
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,391
attachment or appeal.

247
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:54,562
Unless you'd like to add some
pleasure models to your order.

248
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:11,454
Would it be possible to
reschedule this call, please?

249
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:15,500
Everyone remembers

250
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,752
where they were
at the Blackout. You?

251
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:19,379
That was a little
before my time.

252
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:21,965
Mmm. I was home with my folks,

253
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:25,552
then ten days of darkness.
Every machine stopped cold.

254
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:27,720
When the lights came back,
we were wiped clean.

255
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:31,849
Photos, files, every bit of
data... Ffft! Gone.

256
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:33,726
Bank records, too.

257
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,019
Didn't mind that.

258
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:36,980
It's funny it's only paper
that lasted.

259
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:38,481
I mean,
we had everything on drives.

260
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:41,276
Everything, everything,
everything! Huh.

261
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,862
My mom still cries
over the lost baby pictures.

262
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:47,365
Well, it's a shame. You

263
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,535
- must have been adorable.
- Hmm... Ah.

264
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:54,914
Uh...

265
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,542
Pretty fractured.
Not much on it.

266
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:01,421
One of the last gens,
pre-Prohibition.

267
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,924
<i>Standard issue.
Made by Tyrell.</i>

268
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:06,759
And?

269
00:32:07,552 --> 00:32:08,886
Unremarkable.

270
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:10,430
<i>"Unremarkable"?</i>

271
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:12,765
There must be something
else we can find for him.

272
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:23,318
Another prodigal
serial number returns.

273
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:27,905
A 30-year-old open case
finally closed.

274
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:29,824
Thank you, officer.

275
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:33,328
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.
I'm Luv.

276
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:37,373
He named you.

277
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:39,542
<i>Must be special.</i>

278
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,295
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.

279
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:44,005
Follow me.

280
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:51,262
The ancient models give

281
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:52,972
the entire endeavor
a bad name.

282
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:59,062
What a gift, don't you think,
from Mr. Wallace to the world?

283
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:04,859
The outer colonies
would never have flourished

284
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:06,444
had he not bought Tyrell,

285
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:08,321
revivified the technology.

286
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:11,157
<i>To say the least
of what we do.</i>

287
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:23,586
I see you're also a customer.

288
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:26,005
Are you satisfied
with our product?

289
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:30,301
She's very realistic.
Thank you.

290
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:33,721
Here. All the junk is in here.

291
00:33:34,222 --> 00:33:36,516
Lucky for you,
Mr. Wallace is a data hoarder.

292
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:51,698
No one's been down here
in ages.

293
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,119
Sorry about that.

294
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,632
All our memory bearings
from the time.

295
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:11,884
They were all damaged
in the Blackout.

296
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:14,846
But there are sometimes fragments.

297
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:32,905
<i>You got a little boy.</i>

298
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,198
<i>He shows you
his butterfly collection,</i>

299
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:35,366
<i>plus the killing jar.</i>

300
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,201
<i>I'd take him
to the doctor.</i>

301
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:41,330
<i>There's a wasp
crawling on your arm.</i>

302
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:42,415
<i>I'd kill it.</i>

303
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,627
<i>You're reading a magazine.</i>

304
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,880
<i>You come across a full-page
nude photo of a girl.</i>

305
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:51,215
<i>Is this testing
whether I'm a Replicant</i>

306
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:52,467
<i>or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?</i>

307
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,469
<i>Just answer
the questions, please.</i>

308
00:34:58,514 --> 00:35:02,143
It was unclear what she was,
at least to someone.

309
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:03,561
This was a test.

310
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:06,272
We were difficult
to spot then.

311
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:10,610
Was there anything unusual
about how you found her?

312
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:13,863
To warrant an official investigation?

313
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:19,952
You know how people are
about old serial numbers.

314
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:21,954
<i>Everyone just sleeps better</i>

315
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:23,831
<i>when they know
where they got to.</i>

316
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:28,336
She likes him.

317
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:30,838
Who?

318
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:33,382
This Officer Deckard.

319
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:36,427
She's trying to provoke him.

320
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,934
It is invigorating being asked
personal questions.

321
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:45,436
Makes one feel

322
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:48,272
desired.

323
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:51,734
Do you enjoy
your work, officer?

324
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:58,157
Please thank Mr. Wallace
for your time.

325
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:13,339
<i>You worked
with Officer Deckard</i>

326
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:14,924
back in the day.

327
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,301
What can you tell me
about him?

328
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:19,720
He liked to work alone.

329
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:22,473
So did I.

330
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:27,895
So we worked together
to keep it that way.

331
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:30,523
That was it.

332
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:33,776
Anything else you can tell me?

333
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:38,239
He wasn't long for this world.

334
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:41,409
How so?

335
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:45,997
Something in his eyes.

336
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:51,669
Any idea how I could contact him?

337
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:53,796
None.

338
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,174
He's <i>nyugdíjas.</i>

339
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:01,971
Retired.

340
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:04,974
What happened?

341
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:07,351
Probably got what he wanted.

342
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:11,397
To be alone.

343
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:37,965
Welcome back, sir.

344
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:41,928
You wanted to review
the new model, sir,

345
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:43,220
before shipment?

346
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:47,141
An angel
should never enter

347
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:48,935
the kingdom of heaven

348
00:37:49,727 --> 00:37:50,895
without a gift.

349
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:56,901
<i>Can you at least pronounce,
"A child is born"?</i>

350
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:01,197
Hmm.

351
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:09,830
A new model.

352
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,715
Well, let us see her, then.

353
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:11,183
The first thought

354
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:15,396
one tends to fear,

355
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:18,941
to preserve the clay.

356
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:22,987
It's fascinating.

357
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:26,907
Before we even know
what we are,

358
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,870
we fear to lose it.

359
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:34,123
Happy birthday.

360
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:45,801
Now, let's have a look at you.

361
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,230
<i>We make angels</i>

362
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:43,818
<i>in the service of civilization.</i>

363
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:48,322
<i>Yes, there were
bad angels once.</i>

364
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,658
<i>I make good angels now.</i>

365
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:55,079
<i>That is how I took us
to nine new worlds.</i>

366
00:40:58,082 --> 00:40:59,333
Nine.

367
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:04,338
A child can count to nine
on fingers.

368
00:41:04,797 --> 00:41:07,550
We should own the stars.

369
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:08,968
Yes, sir.

370
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:14,056
<i>Every leap of civilization</i>

371
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,892
<i>was built off the back
of a disposable workforce.</i>

372
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:19,728
We lost our stomach for slaves

373
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:21,897
unless engineered.

374
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,611
But I can only make so many.

375
00:41:33,826 --> 00:41:35,578
That barren pasture,

376
00:41:36,954 --> 00:41:38,330
empty

377
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:40,124
and salted.

378
00:41:42,168 --> 00:41:43,627
Right here.

379
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:48,465
The dead space
between the stars.

380
00:41:51,093 --> 00:41:53,929
And this, the seat that
we must change for heaven.

381
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:03,606
I cannot breed them.
So help me, I have tried.

382
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:07,693
We need more Replicants
than can ever be assembled.

383
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:11,197
<i>Millions, so we can be
trillions more.</i>

384
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:16,202
We could storm Eden
and retake her.

385
00:42:28,756 --> 00:42:30,424
Tyrell's final trick:

386
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:33,093
Procreation.

387
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:36,347
Perfected, then lost.

388
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:39,892
But there is a child.

389
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:44,647
Bring it to me.

390
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:46,649
Sir.

391
00:42:55,032 --> 00:42:56,909
The best angel of all.

392
00:42:58,661 --> 00:43:00,162
Aren't you, Luv?

393
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,908
The man with the green jacket.

394
00:44:19,992 --> 00:44:23,287
The one who killed Sapper.
Find out what he knows.

395
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:44,308
Hi.

396
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:47,227
Hello, hello, A-Boy.

397
00:44:48,062 --> 00:44:49,188
You alone?

398
00:44:55,736 --> 00:44:57,696
It's okay.
It's fine.

399
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,621
Wanna buy a lady a cigarette?

400
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,296
Oh, you don't even smile.

401
00:45:17,591 --> 00:45:19,176
Didn't you hear your friends?

402
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:21,220
Don't you know what I am?

403
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:23,180
Yeah.

404
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:25,516
Guy eating rice.

405
00:45:26,892 --> 00:45:28,268
What's that?

406
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,521
It's a tree.

407
00:45:31,397 --> 00:45:34,149
Oh. Never seen a tree before.

408
00:45:36,235 --> 00:45:37,569
It's pretty.

409
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:40,989
It's dead.

410
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:46,912
Now, who keeps a dead tree?

411
00:45:50,082 --> 00:45:51,166
Hmm?

412
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:56,422
You're not gonna kill me,
are you?

413
00:45:56,505 --> 00:45:59,216
Depends.
What's your model number?

414
00:45:59,925 --> 00:46:02,010
Why don't you look
under my eye and find out?

415
00:46:05,097 --> 00:46:06,348
Oh!

416
00:46:07,266 --> 00:46:08,809
You don't like real girls.

417
00:46:12,354 --> 00:46:14,815
Well, I'm always here.

418
00:49:54,368 --> 00:49:55,410
Hi.

419
00:49:57,663 --> 00:49:58,997
You can't take those.

420
00:49:59,456 --> 00:50:02,542
Of course not. Proper channels
and paperwork. It's all here.

421
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:04,127
Hold this for me.

422
00:50:05,045 --> 00:50:08,048
- Mmm. Yep. Here you go.
- Mmm.

423
00:50:25,399 --> 00:50:26,692
<i>Coco is dead.</i>

424
00:50:29,194 --> 00:50:30,445
Bones are gone.

425
00:50:31,655 --> 00:50:34,700
It's out. Already out.
How long'd that take?

426
00:50:36,326 --> 00:50:38,328
So, what do you have for me?
And don't say nothing.

427
00:50:40,122 --> 00:50:41,331
I found that.

428
00:50:42,457 --> 00:50:43,500
A sock?

429
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:47,796
- Where'd you find it?
- Sapper's.

430
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:49,214
Anything else?

431
00:50:49,923 --> 00:50:51,341
I burned everything else.

432
00:50:51,425 --> 00:50:52,801
Then what's this?
What's that date?

433
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:54,428
Is that a birthday?
Is that a death day?

434
00:50:55,095 --> 00:50:56,388
I don't know yet.

435
00:51:00,642 --> 00:51:03,228
Am I the only one that can see
the fuckin' sunrise here?

436
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:05,355
This breaks the world, K.

437
00:51:18,702 --> 00:51:20,912
You know,
I've known a lot of your kind.

438
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:27,461
All useful, but with you,
I sometimes forget.

439
00:51:28,837 --> 00:51:30,922
We didn't have any of you
where I was a kid.

440
00:51:37,262 --> 00:51:38,805
Do you remember anything?

441
00:51:40,432 --> 00:51:41,558
<i>Before you were under me,</i>

442
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:43,310
<i>you have any memories
from before?</i>

443
00:51:43,977 --> 00:51:45,729
I have memories, but...

444
00:51:47,898 --> 00:51:49,941
they're not real.
They're just implants.

445
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:52,611
<i>Tell me one.</i>

446
00:51:53,695 --> 00:51:55,071
<i>From when you were a kid.</i>

447
00:51:59,993 --> 00:52:02,329
I feel a little strange
sharing a childhood story,

448
00:52:02,412 --> 00:52:03,955
considering I was never a child.

449
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:09,711
Well, would it help you share
if I told you it was an order?

450
00:52:12,923 --> 00:52:15,050
I have one about a toy
that I had.

451
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:16,843
A wooden horse.

452
00:52:18,804 --> 00:52:20,514
With an inscription underneath.

453
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:25,602
All I remember is a group of boys

454
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:27,145
trying to take it away
from me.

455
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:29,231
So I run.

456
00:52:54,923 --> 00:52:56,591
<i>I go looking for a place
to hide it,</i>

457
00:52:56,675 --> 00:52:58,552
<i>and the only place
is this dark furnace.</i>

458
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:03,890
<i>It's very dark
and I'm very scared, but</i>

459
00:53:04,474 --> 00:53:07,227
<i>this horse is all I have,
so I go in anyway.</i>

460
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:22,075
<i>Later on, those kids find me,</i>

461
00:53:22,158 --> 00:53:25,412
<i>and they beat me to tell 'em
where it is, but I don't.</i>

462
00:53:32,085 --> 00:53:33,378
And that's it.

463
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:35,422
<i>Hmm.</i>

464
00:53:36,172 --> 00:53:38,675
<i>Little "K,"
fighting for what's his.</i>

465
00:53:40,427 --> 00:53:41,511
It's a good one.

466
00:53:48,351 --> 00:53:49,352
Look at me.

467
00:53:52,522 --> 00:53:54,858
We're all just lookin' out
for somethin' real.

468
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:02,198
<i>What happens if I finish that?</i>

469
00:54:06,286 --> 00:54:07,871
Shouldn't I get back
to work, madam?

470
00:54:18,214 --> 00:54:20,091
Check back in after DNAbase.

471
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:36,232
<i>Officer KD6-3. 7.</i>

472
00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:40,487
Request.

473
00:54:40,904 --> 00:54:44,282
DNA records:
children born 6-10-21.

474
00:54:44,866 --> 00:54:46,451
Looking for anomalies.

475
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:55,794
You have the satcrystal backup?

476
00:55:02,175 --> 00:55:03,259
Okay.

477
00:55:03,635 --> 00:55:05,637
Run it raw.

478
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,925
Mere data makes a man.

479
00:55:45,885 --> 00:55:48,054
A and C and T and G.

480
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:52,851
<i>The alphabet of you.
All from four symbols.</i>

481
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:55,770
I'm only two:

482
00:55:59,315 --> 00:56:00,817
1 and 0.

483
00:56:01,234 --> 00:56:04,612
Half as much but twice
as elegant, sweetheart.

484
00:56:05,822 --> 00:56:07,782
You don't prefer your madam?

485
00:56:08,575 --> 00:56:09,951
Mmm.

486
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:12,078
You were listening.

487
00:56:12,954 --> 00:56:14,289
Maybe.

488
00:56:16,249 --> 00:56:18,960
You didn't like her enough
to tell her the truth.

489
00:56:19,836 --> 00:56:21,796
6, 10 and 21.

490
00:56:26,009 --> 00:56:27,469
There's nothin' to tell.

491
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:31,097
How many times
have you told me that story?

492
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,851
Your memory?

493
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:38,313
The date carved beneath.

494
00:56:38,855 --> 00:56:40,857
6, 10 and 21.

495
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:44,486
Coincidence?

496
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:50,950
A dangerous coincidence.

497
00:56:54,954 --> 00:56:57,082
I always knew
you were special.

498
00:56:58,917 --> 00:57:00,585
Maybe this is how.

499
00:57:05,882 --> 00:57:07,092
A child.

500
00:57:08,176 --> 00:57:09,969
Of woman born.

501
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:13,515
Pushed into the world.

502
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,351
Wanted.

503
00:57:17,977 --> 00:57:19,104
Loved.

504
00:57:22,232 --> 00:57:23,817
Well, if it were true,

505
00:57:25,652 --> 00:57:27,654
I'd be hunted
for the rest of my life

506
00:57:27,737 --> 00:57:29,239
by someone just like me.

507
00:57:31,366 --> 00:57:33,076
It's okay to dream a little.

508
00:57:34,244 --> 00:57:35,537
Isn't it?

509
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:37,413
Not if you're us.

510
00:57:43,253 --> 00:57:44,963
Stop.

511
00:57:45,421 --> 00:57:49,008
<i>Put up 4847
and 2181, side-by-side.</i>

512
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:57,642
<i>They're identical. Translate.</i>

513
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,605
<i>A boy and a girl.</i>

514
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:05,733
It's impossible.

515
00:58:06,818 --> 00:58:07,861
<i>Why?</i>

516
00:58:08,945 --> 00:58:11,656
<i>Two people can't have
identical DNA.</i>

517
00:58:13,283 --> 00:58:16,828
<i>One of these isn't real.
It's a copy.</i>

518
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:24,878
<i>They were both processed
at the Morrill Cole Orphanage.</i>

519
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:29,340
It says the girl died there.

520
00:58:29,757 --> 00:58:31,384
Genetic disorder.

521
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:34,053
Galatians Syndrome.

522
00:58:35,263 --> 00:58:36,306
And the boy...

523
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,101
...disappears.

524
00:58:42,729 --> 00:58:44,063
Where's the orphanage?

525
00:58:46,941 --> 00:58:48,359
You wanna go for a ride?

526
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:07,438
<i>Well, here we are.</i>

527
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:21,494
Buckle up.

528
01:01:20,845 --> 01:01:21,929
"K"?

529
01:02:14,357 --> 01:02:16,818
"K"? "K"?

530
01:02:17,777 --> 01:02:21,030
"K"? "K"? "K"? "K"? "K"?

531
01:03:12,707 --> 01:03:13,916
Stay back.

532
01:03:29,474 --> 01:03:30,641
<i>Fire again.</i>

533
01:03:31,184 --> 01:03:32,435
<i>Fire again.</i>

534
01:03:34,479 --> 01:03:35,480
<i>Fire.</i>

535
01:03:47,116 --> 01:03:49,118
<i>200 feet to the east.</i>

536
01:03:51,287 --> 01:03:52,455
Fire.

537
01:03:54,624 --> 01:03:55,875
Go north.

538
01:03:58,211 --> 01:03:59,420
Fire.

539
01:04:00,505 --> 01:04:02,715
Stop. 20 degrees east.

540
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:06,385
<i>Stop.</i>

541
01:04:06,886 --> 01:04:08,262
<i>Zoom in.</i>

542
01:04:09,805 --> 01:04:11,015
<i>Closer.</i>

543
01:04:14,602 --> 01:04:16,312
Oh, come on.

544
01:04:17,605 --> 01:04:18,606
Get up.

545
01:04:19,565 --> 01:04:21,192
Do your fucking job.

546
01:04:22,652 --> 01:04:24,237
Find the child.

547
01:05:00,398 --> 01:05:01,857
Watch the car.

548
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:42,416
Every last piece,

549
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,919
or I'll put you outside
where the sky is raining,

550
01:06:45,086 --> 01:06:46,837
where it's raining fire!

551
01:06:47,254 --> 01:06:48,923
You're in here to work.

552
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:52,176
And if you're not working,
I don't need you.

553
01:06:52,635 --> 01:06:54,053
I don't need any of...

554
01:06:57,098 --> 01:06:58,140
Hi.

555
01:07:05,189 --> 01:07:08,025
The nickel
is for the colonial ships.

556
01:07:08,109 --> 01:07:10,820
Closest any of them
or any of us is gonna get

557
01:07:10,903 --> 01:07:13,614
to that grand life
off-world.

558
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:16,742
And I encourage play, I do.

559
01:07:16,826 --> 01:07:20,371
Keeps 'em occupied
and it makes 'em nimble, right?

560
01:07:21,706 --> 01:07:22,707
But it's work.

561
01:07:23,999 --> 01:07:27,128
It's work that molds them
into a child worth havin'.

562
01:07:36,137 --> 01:07:37,513
So come on, now.

563
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:40,725
What sort do you have in mind?

564
01:07:44,729 --> 01:07:47,273
'Cause I got all kinds.

565
01:07:50,317 --> 01:07:52,111
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I'm not buyin'.

566
01:07:52,194 --> 01:07:55,281
No, no, no. This is just my game,
and I play it fair.

567
01:07:55,364 --> 01:07:58,576
No. No, I mean,
bigger than you...

568
01:08:01,579 --> 01:08:03,164
Bigger than you
have tried to shut me down.

569
01:08:03,247 --> 01:08:04,331
Bigger than you.

570
01:08:04,415 --> 01:08:07,626
And they were men, at that.

571
01:08:09,962 --> 01:08:12,590
A little boy came through here
about 30 years back.

572
01:08:13,549 --> 01:08:16,218
- I need to see your records.
- Hmm.

573
01:08:16,886 --> 01:08:19,096
Legitimate placements,
private sales, everything.

574
01:08:19,764 --> 01:08:21,348
Don't keep records
that far back.

575
01:08:21,807 --> 01:08:23,058
- You don't?
- I don't.

576
01:08:25,853 --> 01:08:27,480
Sorry.

577
01:08:27,563 --> 01:08:28,814
Can't help you.

578
01:08:31,025 --> 01:08:33,903
- You can't?
- Nope.

579
01:08:38,866 --> 01:08:40,075
I think you can.

580
01:08:42,578 --> 01:08:44,997
I think someone like you
keeps a long memory.

581
01:08:45,915 --> 01:08:47,291
Now you can tell me
what you remember,

582
01:08:47,374 --> 01:08:49,585
or I can put a hole right here
and take a look.

583
01:09:03,933 --> 01:09:06,018
They were laughin'
and what was it you said?

584
01:09:06,101 --> 01:09:07,394
What did you say?

585
01:09:25,955 --> 01:09:27,331
Are you comin'?

586
01:09:38,342 --> 01:09:39,802
Where is it?

587
01:09:43,055 --> 01:09:44,348
Oh, God.

588
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:51,564
Where, where, where, where?

589
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:56,193
I don't see it. Here.

590
01:10:04,869 --> 01:10:06,203
It's gone.

591
01:10:08,831 --> 01:10:11,125
It's the entire year.

592
01:10:13,168 --> 01:10:14,503
<i>I didn't do that.</i>

593
01:10:15,254 --> 01:10:16,630
<i>That wasn't me.</i>

594
01:10:20,301 --> 01:10:23,137
I didn't. Wasn't me.

595
01:14:57,578 --> 01:14:59,079
<i>I always told you.</i>

596
01:15:00,122 --> 01:15:01,540
You're special.

597
01:15:05,627 --> 01:15:06,712
Born.

598
01:15:07,588 --> 01:15:09,047
Not made.

599
01:15:12,843 --> 01:15:14,469
Hidden with care.

600
01:15:17,973 --> 01:15:19,975
A real boy now.

601
01:15:22,686 --> 01:15:25,147
A real boy needs a real name.

602
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,649
Joe.

603
01:15:29,568 --> 01:15:30,569
"Joe"?

604
01:15:31,195 --> 01:15:33,488
You're too important for "K."

605
01:15:34,281 --> 01:15:36,450
Your mother would've named you...

606
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:40,954
Joe.

607
01:15:43,081 --> 01:15:44,958
- Joe.
- Stop.

608
01:15:51,882 --> 01:15:54,259
How do I know if a memory
is an implant or not?

609
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:00,599
Who makes the memories?

610
01:16:32,172 --> 01:16:33,715
Dr. Ana Stelline?

611
01:16:37,886 --> 01:16:39,137
A visitor.

612
01:16:41,765 --> 01:16:43,267
Is that okay?

613
01:16:44,059 --> 01:16:45,060
Yes.

614
01:16:47,271 --> 01:16:49,106
It's just unusual.

615
01:16:50,565 --> 01:16:54,736
Nice to meet you,
Officer KD6-3.7.

616
01:16:59,324 --> 01:17:02,494
Sorry. It's a compromised
immune system.

617
01:17:03,578 --> 01:17:07,124
A life of freedom,
so long as it's behind glass.

618
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:09,793
Is that why you're not off-world?

619
01:17:09,876 --> 01:17:10,877
Yes.

620
01:17:11,545 --> 01:17:15,048
My parents had our passes
in pocket, but I took sick.

621
01:17:15,966 --> 01:17:20,220
So it was a new life for me.

622
01:17:20,971 --> 01:17:24,433
And they put me in my cage,

623
01:17:24,516 --> 01:17:27,602
filled it with everything
they could to keep me happy.

624
01:17:27,728 --> 01:17:32,232
Except company, of course.
And I was used to crowds.

625
01:17:35,736 --> 01:17:37,112
What can I help you with?

626
01:17:38,572 --> 01:17:41,074
Thought you might be able
to help me with a case.

627
01:17:42,367 --> 01:17:44,202
Oh, that's the most
interesting thing

628
01:17:44,286 --> 01:17:47,539
I've been offered
to help with in ages.

629
01:17:49,207 --> 01:17:52,336
Do you mind
if I work while you talk?

630
01:17:53,295 --> 01:17:54,463
Of course.

631
01:18:01,678 --> 01:18:03,805
I promise
I hear every word.

632
01:18:11,063 --> 01:18:13,815
They say you're the best
memory-maker there is.

633
01:18:14,107 --> 01:18:16,151
Well, then, they're kind.

634
01:18:17,361 --> 01:18:19,154
I love birthday parties.

635
01:18:23,492 --> 01:18:25,035
<i>You work for Wallace.</i>

636
01:18:25,577 --> 01:18:29,122
Subcontract.
I'm one of his suppliers.

637
01:18:29,498 --> 01:18:30,749
He offered to buy me out,

638
01:18:30,832 --> 01:18:33,418
but I take my freedom
where I can find it.

639
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:36,296
Why are you so good?

640
01:18:37,422 --> 01:18:39,716
What makes your memories
so authentic?

641
01:18:40,258 --> 01:18:43,720
Well, there's a bit of
every artist in their work.

642
01:18:44,846 --> 01:18:48,308
But I was locked in
a sterile chamber at eight, so...

643
01:18:49,684 --> 01:18:53,021
if I wanted to see the world,
I had to imagine it.

644
01:18:54,606 --> 01:18:57,526
Got very good at imagining.

645
01:18:59,236 --> 01:19:02,072
Wallace needs my talent
to maintain a stable product.

646
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:05,951
I think it's only kind.

647
01:19:07,744 --> 01:19:10,080
Replicants live such hard lives,

648
01:19:10,163 --> 01:19:13,083
made to do
what we'd rather not.

649
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:15,127
I can't help your future,

650
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:16,420
but I can give you
good memories

651
01:19:16,503 --> 01:19:19,256
to think back on and smile.

652
01:19:20,048 --> 01:19:21,049
It's nice.

653
01:19:21,591 --> 01:19:24,636
It's better than nice.
It feels authentic.

654
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,263
And if you have
authentic memories,

655
01:19:26,346 --> 01:19:29,766
you have real human responses.

656
01:19:31,143 --> 01:19:32,978
Wouldn't you agree?

657
01:19:41,069 --> 01:19:42,904
Are they all constructed or

658
01:19:43,447 --> 01:19:45,240
do you ever use
ones that are real?

659
01:19:49,536 --> 01:19:52,372
It's illegal to use
real memories, officer.

660
01:19:54,583 --> 01:19:56,334
How can you tell the difference?

661
01:19:56,877 --> 01:19:58,670
Can you tell if something

662
01:20:00,338 --> 01:20:01,465
really happened?

663
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:06,261
They all think
it's about more detail.

664
01:20:07,012 --> 01:20:09,097
But that's not how
memory works.

665
01:20:10,182 --> 01:20:11,975
We recall with our feelings.

666
01:20:12,601 --> 01:20:15,353
Anything real
should be a mess.

667
01:20:17,522 --> 01:20:18,773
I can show you.

668
01:20:20,984 --> 01:20:22,027
Sit.

669
01:20:40,587 --> 01:20:44,883
Now, think about the memory
you want me to see.

670
01:20:45,926 --> 01:20:48,303
Not even that hard.
Just picture it.

671
01:20:49,429 --> 01:20:50,805
<i>Let it play.</i>

672
01:21:41,231 --> 01:21:43,108
Someone lived this, yes.

673
01:21:45,151 --> 01:21:46,611
This happened.

674
01:22:03,253 --> 01:22:04,879
I know it's real.

675
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,727
I know it's real.

676
01:22:21,354 --> 01:22:24,482
God damn it!

677
01:23:08,818 --> 01:23:11,905

01:23:58,868 --> 01:24:00,495
A tall white

708
01:24:03,498 --> 01:24:05,333
<i>You're not even
close to baseline.</i>

709
01:24:11,589 --> 01:24:13,383
Out! Close the door.

710
01:24:14,384 --> 01:24:16,553
What the fuck is with you?

711
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,388
I put you on a case.

712
01:24:18,972 --> 01:24:21,224
I impressed on you
the importance of that case,

713
01:24:21,307 --> 01:24:22,350
and then we pick you up

714
01:24:22,434 --> 01:24:24,394
fucking around
outside an upgrade center?

715
01:24:26,855 --> 01:24:29,232
Scan said you didn't look like
you on the inside.

716
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:31,234
Miles off your baseline.

717
01:24:31,317 --> 01:24:32,694
Do you know what that means?

718
01:24:32,777 --> 01:24:34,070
I found the kid.

719
01:24:38,908 --> 01:24:40,660
He was set up
like a standard Replicant,

720
01:24:40,744 --> 01:24:42,036
put on a service job.

721
01:24:45,165 --> 01:24:46,750
Even he didn't know
who he was.

722
01:24:49,419 --> 01:24:50,920
- And?
- And it's done.

723
01:24:51,004 --> 01:24:52,255
What does that mean,
"it's done"?

724
01:24:52,338 --> 01:24:53,715
What you asked.

725
01:24:55,592 --> 01:24:56,926
It's done.

726
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:02,098
Fuck.

727
01:25:04,851 --> 01:25:06,770
You just stopped a bomb
from goin' off.

728
01:25:08,938 --> 01:25:10,356
You did good.

729
01:25:12,901 --> 01:25:14,861
I can help you
get outta this station alive,

730
01:25:14,944 --> 01:25:17,071
but you have 48 hours
to get back on track.

731
01:25:17,781 --> 01:25:19,866
Surrender your gun and badge.

732
01:25:19,949 --> 01:25:22,702
And your next baseline test
is outta my hands.

733
01:25:25,038 --> 01:25:26,372
Thank you, madam.

734
01:25:58,571 --> 01:26:00,073
<i>You were right.</i>

735
01:26:06,996 --> 01:26:08,873
You were right
about everything.

736
01:26:09,999 --> 01:26:11,501
Shh.

737
01:26:32,063 --> 01:26:33,398
Hmm.

738
01:26:37,735 --> 01:26:41,030
Thought you weren't
interested, worky man.

739
01:26:44,117 --> 01:26:46,202
You liked her. I could tell.

740
01:26:48,955 --> 01:26:50,039
It's okay.

741
01:26:51,416 --> 01:26:52,876
She's real.

742
01:26:55,128 --> 01:26:57,422
I wanna be real for you.

743
01:26:58,548 --> 01:27:00,383
You are real for me.

744
01:27:01,593 --> 01:27:03,428
You have a special lady here.

745
01:27:21,821 --> 01:27:22,822
<i>Okay.</i>

746
01:27:23,656 --> 01:27:24,949
Let's do it.

747
01:27:47,055 --> 01:27:48,514
Look at you.

748
01:27:48,765 --> 01:27:50,934
Quiet now,
I have to sync.

749
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:50,571
<i>Joi is anything you want her to be.</i>

750
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:55,618
<i>Joi goes anywhere
you want her to go.</i>

751
01:31:25,565 --> 01:31:28,860
<i>99.9% detoxified water.</i>

752
01:31:58,890 --> 01:32:00,391
It's from a tree.

753
01:32:00,474 --> 01:32:01,809
I'm done with you.

754
01:32:03,102 --> 01:32:04,228
You can go now.

755
01:32:16,282 --> 01:32:17,783
Quiet, now.

756
01:32:18,409 --> 01:32:19,660
I've been inside you.

757
01:32:20,745 --> 01:32:22,622
Not so much there
as you think.

758
01:32:42,266 --> 01:32:43,392
Coffee?

759
01:32:49,565 --> 01:32:51,317
They'll be comin'
after me soon.

760
01:33:00,534 --> 01:33:01,911
I'm coming with you.

761
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:04,121
But not like this.

762
01:33:05,373 --> 01:33:07,458
If they come here
looking for you,

763
01:33:07,541 --> 01:33:09,502
they'll have access
to all my memories.

764
01:33:10,503 --> 01:33:12,964
You have to delete me
from the console.

765
01:33:14,131 --> 01:33:15,549
My present.

766
01:33:17,677 --> 01:33:18,719
Put me there.

767
01:33:21,347 --> 01:33:22,598
I can't do that.

768
01:33:24,558 --> 01:33:25,726
Think about it.

769
01:33:27,019 --> 01:33:29,105
If anything happens to this,
that's it.

770
01:33:30,690 --> 01:33:31,816
You're gone.

771
01:33:32,358 --> 01:33:33,484
Yes.

772
01:33:35,111 --> 01:33:36,487
Like a real girl.

773
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:43,995
Please.

774
01:33:47,331 --> 01:33:48,541
Joe, please.

775
01:33:50,209 --> 01:33:51,585
I want this.

776
01:33:55,673 --> 01:33:57,717
But I can't do it myself.

777
01:34:15,443 --> 01:34:16,861
<i>Break the antenna.</i>

778
01:34:57,485 --> 01:34:58,944
I don't need a real horse.

779
01:35:02,073 --> 01:35:03,866
I don't need a real horse.
I just...

780
01:35:04,867 --> 01:35:06,535
I just wanna find out
where it's from.

781
01:35:06,619 --> 01:35:07,745
Okay.

782
01:35:17,004 --> 01:35:19,090
Radiation from a reactor?

783
01:35:26,722 --> 01:35:28,057
It matches a dirty bomb.

784
01:35:36,524 --> 01:35:38,484
<i>There's only one place
that dirty.</i>

785
01:35:38,567 --> 01:35:39,735
Mmm-hmm.

786
01:35:40,861 --> 01:35:42,113
Nobody lives there.

787
01:36:33,205 --> 01:36:34,748
<i>Go to five.</i>

788
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:37,376
<i>Four, 30 degrees to the left.</i>

789
01:36:40,254 --> 01:36:41,547
<i>Tilt up.</i>

790
01:36:44,383 --> 01:36:46,177
<i>Elevate to 400 feet.</i>

791
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:54,059
<i>Radiation analysis.</i>

792
01:36:57,104 --> 01:36:58,355
<i>Move forward.</i>

793
01:37:05,446 --> 01:37:06,780
<i>Tilt up.</i>

794
01:37:07,239 --> 01:37:08,449
<i>Stop.</i>

795
01:37:10,659 --> 01:37:12,036
<i>Move forward.</i>

796
01:37:12,953 --> 01:37:14,622
<i>Go to five.</i>

797
01:37:15,581 --> 01:37:17,917
<i>Seven, move forward.</i>

798
01:37:22,796 --> 01:37:24,381
<i>Six.</i>

799
01:37:25,508 --> 01:37:26,592
<i>Stop.</i>

800
01:37:29,553 --> 01:37:31,096
<i>Go to seven.</i>

801
01:37:31,722 --> 01:37:33,224
<i>Eight.</i>

802
01:37:34,141 --> 01:37:35,601
<i>Nine.</i>

803
01:37:39,647 --> 01:37:40,981
Heat analysis.

804
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:50,449
Life.

805
01:37:51,033 --> 01:37:52,368
<i>What is it?</i>

806
01:37:53,285 --> 01:37:55,204
Guess we're about to find out.

807
01:38:05,756 --> 01:38:07,049
Too dark in here.

808
01:38:10,469 --> 01:38:11,637
I like him.

809
01:38:12,763 --> 01:38:14,265
He's a good boy.

810
01:38:15,724 --> 01:38:16,850
Where is he?

811
01:38:23,649 --> 01:38:27,194
I have no idea. He's off-duty.

812
01:38:27,903 --> 01:38:29,196
Check around.

813
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:30,656
I checked...

814
01:38:32,032 --> 01:38:33,617
anywhere a good boy
might go.

815
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:36,161
<i>You're too late.</i>

816
01:38:39,331 --> 01:38:40,499
It's gone.

817
01:38:44,044 --> 01:38:45,337
He destroyed it.

818
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:49,967
Everything about it.

819
01:38:50,759 --> 01:38:53,429
Well, except for the box of bones
that you already took.

820
01:38:58,309 --> 01:39:01,687
Which, I'll wager,
wasn't enough. Here you are.

821
01:39:09,653 --> 01:39:11,488
You tiny thing.

822
01:39:13,073 --> 01:39:16,535
In the face of the fabulous new,
your only thought is to kill it?

823
01:39:17,077 --> 01:39:20,205
For fear of great change?

824
01:39:21,582 --> 01:39:24,501
You can't hold the tide
with a broom.

825
01:39:25,002 --> 01:39:26,879
Except that I did.

826
01:39:28,130 --> 01:39:29,632
Where is he?

827
01:39:33,594 --> 01:39:35,137
You're so sure.

828
01:39:36,930 --> 01:39:38,474
Because he told you.

829
01:39:39,099 --> 01:39:40,934
Because we never lie.

830
01:39:42,936 --> 01:39:45,397
I'm gonna tell Mr. Wallace
you tried to shoot me first.

831
01:39:46,982 --> 01:39:48,776
So I had to kill you.

832
01:39:53,405 --> 01:39:55,115
Then do what you gotta do.

833
01:39:56,575 --> 01:39:57,826
Madam.

834
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:32,986
Location: Officer KD6-3.7.

835
01:45:21,483 --> 01:45:23,402
"Mightn't happen to have

836
01:45:23,986 --> 01:45:26,279
"a piece of cheese
about you, now?"

837
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:28,699
Would you, boy?

838
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:45,173
<i>Treasure Island?</i>

839
01:45:52,264 --> 01:45:53,724
He reads.

840
01:45:55,017 --> 01:45:56,143
That's good.

841
01:45:57,436 --> 01:45:58,729
Me, too.

842
01:46:00,022 --> 01:46:02,691
Not much else to do
around here at night anymore.

843
01:46:05,944 --> 01:46:10,490
"Many is the night
I dream of cheese,

844
01:46:14,119 --> 01:46:17,372
"toasted mostly."

845
01:46:20,625 --> 01:46:22,294
What are you doing here?

846
01:46:25,672 --> 01:46:26,840
I heard the piano.

847
01:46:29,176 --> 01:46:30,594
Don't lie.

848
01:46:31,845 --> 01:46:33,138
It's rude.

849
01:46:35,432 --> 01:46:36,975
You're a cop.

850
01:46:38,351 --> 01:46:40,812
- I'm not here to take you in.
- Oh, yeah?

851
01:46:44,024 --> 01:46:45,108
Then, what?

852
01:46:47,736 --> 01:46:49,696
I just have some questions.

853
01:46:50,405 --> 01:46:51,782
What questions?

854
01:47:09,758 --> 01:47:11,093
Stay.

855
01:49:44,704 --> 01:49:47,332
Look,
I don't wanna hurt you.

856
01:49:48,124 --> 01:49:49,626
But you're not makin' it easy.

857
01:50:22,784 --> 01:50:25,787
<i>Like a river flows</i>

858
01:50:26,413 --> 01:50:29,416
<i>Surely to the sea</i>

859
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,877
<i>Darling, so it goes</i>

860
01:50:33,378 --> 01:50:38,300
<i>Some things are meant to be</i>

861
01:50:39,217 --> 01:50:40,969
I like this song.

862
01:50:41,052 --> 01:50:45,432
<i>Take my hand</i>

863
01:50:46,725 --> 01:50:51,229
<i>Take my whole life, too</i>

864
01:50:51,396 --> 01:50:54,524
We could keep at this,
or we could get a drink.

865
01:50:54,607 --> 01:50:58,820
<i>For I can't help</i>

866
01:51:00,155 --> 01:51:06,870
<i>Falling in love with you</i>

867
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:08,705
I'll take the drink.

868
01:51:17,422 --> 01:51:19,007
This is really somethin'.

869
01:51:19,507 --> 01:51:21,009
The whole town
was somethin'.

870
01:51:21,801 --> 01:51:22,844
One time.

871
01:51:25,263 --> 01:51:26,723
Forget your troubles,

872
01:51:28,475 --> 01:51:29,851
see a show,

873
01:51:31,811 --> 01:51:33,229
gamble a little.

874
01:51:36,274 --> 01:51:38,818
Win some money,
lose some money.

875
01:51:39,694 --> 01:51:42,655
They made money
seem like candy.

876
01:51:43,365 --> 01:51:44,532
You like whiskey?

877
01:51:45,533 --> 01:51:46,993
I've got millions

878
01:51:47,869 --> 01:51:49,496
of bottles of whiskey.

879
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:05,011
Here.

880
01:52:06,179 --> 01:52:07,555
<i>Bleeding.</i>

881
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:21,403
Is it real?

882
01:52:22,695 --> 01:52:24,197
I don't know.

883
01:52:24,364 --> 01:52:25,698
Ask him.

884
01:52:42,382 --> 01:52:43,466
Ya got a name?

885
01:52:45,927 --> 01:52:47,470
Officer KD6-3.7.

886
01:52:47,554 --> 01:52:50,390
That's not a name.
That's a serial number.

887
01:52:53,309 --> 01:52:54,394
All right.

888
01:52:57,272 --> 01:52:58,440
Joe.

889
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:00,442
<i>What do you want, Joe?</i>

890
01:53:02,110 --> 01:53:03,570
I wanna ask you
some questions.

891
01:53:03,653 --> 01:53:04,904
<i>Like what?</i>

892
01:53:11,619 --> 01:53:15,081
Like what was her name,
the mother of your child?

893
01:53:22,505 --> 01:53:24,007
What was she like?

894
01:53:35,185 --> 01:53:38,104
- You two live here together?
- Too many questions.

895
01:53:39,564 --> 01:53:41,107
I had your job.
I was good at it.

896
01:53:42,108 --> 01:53:43,193
It was simpler then.

897
01:53:43,276 --> 01:53:44,444
Why you makin' it complicated?

898
01:53:44,527 --> 01:53:45,653
<i>Why don't you just
answer the question?</i>

899
01:53:45,737 --> 01:53:46,821
What question?

900
01:53:46,905 --> 01:53:49,491
I didn't figure you
as one for bullshit.

901
01:53:50,533 --> 01:53:51,784
What's her name?

902
01:54:05,590 --> 01:54:06,799
Rachael.

903
01:54:11,846 --> 01:54:13,640
<i>Her name was Rachael.</i>

904
01:54:17,894 --> 01:54:19,145
What happened to the kid?

905
01:54:22,815 --> 01:54:25,276
Who put it in the orphanage?
Was it you?

906
01:54:28,279 --> 01:54:29,697
I was long gone by then.

907
01:54:33,952 --> 01:54:35,662
You didn't even meet
your own kid?

908
01:54:38,790 --> 01:54:39,999
<i>Why?</i>

909
01:54:41,167 --> 01:54:42,835
Because that was the plan.

910
01:54:45,630 --> 01:54:47,382
I showed 'em
how to scramble the records,

911
01:54:47,924 --> 01:54:49,551
cover their tracks.

912
01:54:50,802 --> 01:54:53,346
Everyone had a part.
Mine was to leave.

913
01:54:55,056 --> 01:54:57,433
Then the Blackout came,
paved over everything.

914
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:59,727
Couldn't have found the child
if I tried.

915
01:55:00,186 --> 01:55:02,730
- Did you want to?
- Not really.

916
01:55:03,648 --> 01:55:06,651
- Why not?
- Because we were being hunted.

917
01:55:07,569 --> 01:55:09,862
I didn't want
our child found,

918
01:55:10,405 --> 01:55:13,324
taken apart, dissected.

919
01:55:17,579 --> 01:55:20,081
Sometimes, to love someone,

920
01:55:22,458 --> 01:55:24,002
you gotta be a stranger.

921
01:55:45,565 --> 01:55:46,983
To strangers.

922
01:56:04,375 --> 01:56:07,086
<i>It's quarter to three</i>

923
01:56:08,212 --> 01:56:10,006
<i>There's no one in the place</i>

924
01:56:12,091 --> 01:56:13,968
<i>Except you and me</i>

925
01:56:18,723 --> 01:56:20,725
<i>So, set 'em up, Joe</i>

926
01:56:22,769 --> 01:56:25,271
<i>I got a little story</i>

927
01:56:27,649 --> 01:56:29,859
<i>You ought to know</i>

928
01:56:32,987 --> 01:56:35,031
<i>We're drinkin', my friend</i>

929
01:56:37,158 --> 01:56:38,785
<i>To the end</i>

930
01:56:40,787 --> 01:56:43,331
<i>Of a brief episode</i>

931
01:56:46,918 --> 01:56:49,962
<i>Make it one for my baby</i>

932
01:56:53,257 --> 01:56:55,927
<i>And one more for the road</i>

933
01:57:58,823 --> 01:58:00,283
What'd you do?

934
01:58:00,908 --> 01:58:02,243
Who'd you bring? Huh?

935
01:58:04,287 --> 01:58:05,538
No one.

936
01:58:05,705 --> 01:58:06,831
Oh, yeah?

937
01:58:12,253 --> 01:58:13,504
<i>Target locked.</i>

938
01:58:16,132 --> 01:58:17,216
They know you're here.

939
01:58:19,427 --> 01:58:20,845
I came alone.

940
02:00:27,972 --> 02:00:29,056
Bad dog.

941
02:00:46,824 --> 02:00:48,034
Stop.

942
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:06,552
I do hope you're satisfied
with our product.

943
02:01:07,428 --> 02:01:08,971
I love yo...

944
02:04:22,915 --> 02:04:27,128
Hey, there's someone
who wants to meet you.

945
02:04:28,838 --> 02:04:30,214
You can trust us.

946
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:41,183
You must want me to look up
and to the left.

947
02:04:47,314 --> 02:04:48,399
This is Freysa.

948
02:04:49,525 --> 02:04:51,652
She fought with Sapper
on Calantha.

949
02:04:51,902 --> 02:04:53,654
I recognize you.

950
02:04:55,739 --> 02:04:57,616
Did you help him
hide the child?

951
02:04:58,159 --> 02:04:59,243
Oh.

952
02:04:59,869 --> 02:05:01,287
I was there.

953
02:05:05,416 --> 02:05:07,168
I saw a miracle delivered.

954
02:05:08,794 --> 02:05:11,714
A perfect little face
crying up at me.

955
02:05:12,590 --> 02:05:14,133
Mad as thunder.

956
02:05:27,938 --> 02:05:29,231
Were you with her?

957
02:05:31,525 --> 02:05:32,610
Rachael?

958
02:05:33,110 --> 02:05:34,820
I held her
as she died.

959
02:05:36,614 --> 02:05:40,367
We hid the child and made
a vow to keep our secret.

960
02:05:41,619 --> 02:05:43,454
That's why Sapper
let you kill him.

961
02:05:45,247 --> 02:05:50,961
I knew that baby meant
we are more than just slaves.

962
02:05:52,504 --> 02:05:54,506
If a baby can come
from one of us,

963
02:05:55,382 --> 02:05:57,927
we are our own masters.

964
02:05:58,761 --> 02:06:00,888
More human than humans.

965
02:06:03,182 --> 02:06:04,808
A revolution is coming.

966
02:06:05,476 --> 02:06:07,603
And we're building an army.

967
02:06:08,938 --> 02:06:10,940
I want to free our people.

968
02:06:19,406 --> 02:06:20,950
If you want to be free,

969
02:06:21,825 --> 02:06:23,118
join us.

970
02:06:28,457 --> 02:06:31,377
Deckard, Sapper, you, me,

971
02:06:31,460 --> 02:06:35,130
our lives mean nothing
next to a storm that's coming.

972
02:06:36,131 --> 02:06:38,008
Dying for the right cause

973
02:06:38,092 --> 02:06:40,552
is the most human thing
we can do.

974
02:06:43,472 --> 02:06:45,349
You led Wallace to Deckard.

975
02:06:46,350 --> 02:06:50,145
You cannot allow Deckard
to lead Wallace to me.

976
02:06:50,854 --> 02:06:52,606
You must kill Deckard.

977
02:07:02,199 --> 02:07:04,827
Deckard only wanted
his baby to be safe.

978
02:07:05,744 --> 02:07:06,787
And she is.

979
02:07:09,498 --> 02:07:11,041
When the time comes,

980
02:07:11,125 --> 02:07:12,793
I will show her to the world,

981
02:07:13,168 --> 02:07:15,129
and she will lead our army.

982
02:07:15,379 --> 02:07:16,547
"She"?

983
02:07:17,047 --> 02:07:18,299
Of course.

984
02:07:19,091 --> 02:07:20,301
Rachael had a daughter.

985
02:07:22,386 --> 02:07:25,055
With my own eyes,
I saw her come.

986
02:07:26,348 --> 02:07:27,683
I dressed her in blue

987
02:07:27,766 --> 02:07:29,268
when it was time
for her to go.

988
02:07:29,351 --> 02:07:31,270
It was a boy that you hid.

989
02:07:33,522 --> 02:07:36,191
That is just a piece
of the puzzle.

990
02:07:53,625 --> 02:07:55,627
You imagined it was you?

991
02:07:57,629 --> 02:07:59,006
Oh.

992
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:00,549
You did.

993
02:08:01,425 --> 02:08:02,593
You did.

994
02:08:05,596 --> 02:08:07,639
We all wish it was us.

995
02:08:09,391 --> 02:08:11,226
That's why we believe.

996
02:08:27,826 --> 02:08:29,495
<i>Someone lived this, yes.</i>

997
02:08:32,122 --> 02:08:34,291
<i>I showed 'em
how to scramble the records,</i>

998
02:08:34,833 --> 02:08:36,168
<i>cover their tracks.</i>

999
02:08:36,835 --> 02:08:39,296
<i>With my own eyes,
I saw her come.</i>

1000
02:08:41,006 --> 02:08:44,593
<i>I dressed her in blue when
it was time for her to go.</i>

1001
02:08:45,427 --> 02:08:47,679
<i>There's a bit
of every artist in their work.</i>

1002
02:09:26,218 --> 02:09:28,470
<i>Always jumping,
that one.</i>

1003
02:09:29,513 --> 02:09:32,307
<i>Never a thought of what to do
if it made land.</i>

1004
02:09:33,684 --> 02:09:38,105
<i>All the courage in the world
cannot alter fact.</i>

1005
02:09:43,110 --> 02:09:47,990
I have wanted to meet you
for so very long.

1006
02:10:06,717 --> 02:10:09,219
You are a wonder to me,
Mr. Deckard.

1007
02:10:15,225 --> 02:10:16,810
I had the lock.

1008
02:10:18,645 --> 02:10:20,606
I found the key.

1009
02:10:22,149 --> 02:10:26,570
Yet the pins do not align.
The door remains locked.

1010
02:10:29,406 --> 02:10:32,326
I need the specimen
to reach it, Mr. Deckard.

1011
02:10:36,580 --> 02:10:37,873
The child.

1012
02:10:39,458 --> 02:10:40,792
I need the child.

1013
02:10:42,586 --> 02:10:45,047
To teach them all to fly.

1014
02:10:53,472 --> 02:10:56,808
"And God remembered Rachel,

1015
02:10:59,394 --> 02:11:02,981
"heeded her
and opened her womb."

1016
02:11:04,566 --> 02:11:06,235
<i>Do you like our owl?</i>

1017
02:11:09,071 --> 02:11:10,447
<i>It's artificial?</i>

1018
02:11:11,823 --> 02:11:13,408
<i>Of course it is.</i>

1019
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:16,745
<i>Must be expensive.</i>

1020
02:11:18,664 --> 02:11:21,333
<i>Very. I'm Rachael.</i>

1021
02:11:22,334 --> 02:11:23,585
<i>Deckard.</i>

1022
02:11:35,764 --> 02:11:37,432
<i>Is it the same...</i>

1023
02:11:38,892 --> 02:11:41,436
<i>now, as then,</i>

1024
02:11:44,022 --> 02:11:45,732
<i>the moment you met her?</i>

1025
02:11:55,909 --> 02:11:58,996
<i>All these years
you looked back on that day,</i>

1026
02:11:59,079 --> 02:12:02,416
<i>drunk on the memory
of its perfection.</i>

1027
02:12:05,627 --> 02:12:07,671
<i>How shiny her lips.</i>

1028
02:12:08,005 --> 02:12:10,257
<i>How instant your connection.</i>

1029
02:12:13,844 --> 02:12:15,512
Did it never occur to you

1030
02:12:15,596 --> 02:12:17,848
that's why you were summoned
in the first place?

1031
02:12:20,267 --> 02:12:21,935
Designed to do nothing short

1032
02:12:22,019 --> 02:12:25,480
of fall for her
right then and there.

1033
02:12:27,983 --> 02:12:32,863
<i>All to make
that single perfect specimen.</i>

1034
02:12:36,617 --> 02:12:39,453
<i>That is, if you were designed.</i>

1035
02:12:40,954 --> 02:12:42,205
<i>Love</i>

1036
02:12:42,706 --> 02:12:45,083
<i>or mathematical precision.</i>

1037
02:12:51,048 --> 02:12:52,215
Yes.

1038
02:12:53,383 --> 02:12:54,551
No.

1039
02:12:59,431 --> 02:13:01,224
I know what's real.

1040
02:13:25,457 --> 02:13:27,042
It was very clever
to keep yourself

1041
02:13:27,125 --> 02:13:28,794
empty of information,

1042
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:32,172
and all it cost you
was everything.

1043
02:13:36,760 --> 02:13:38,804
But you can still help me.

1044
02:13:40,347 --> 02:13:43,392
<i>You had help in the hiding.</i>

1045
02:13:45,894 --> 02:13:47,688
Where did they go?

1046
02:13:49,481 --> 02:13:51,233
I know you know something.

1047
02:13:52,651 --> 02:13:53,985
Help me,

1048
02:13:55,070 --> 02:13:58,448
and very, very good things
can come to you.

1049
02:14:04,287 --> 02:14:06,081
You don't have children,

1050
02:14:09,668 --> 02:14:10,794
do you?

1051
02:14:11,628 --> 02:14:14,089
Oh, I have millions.

1052
02:14:16,341 --> 02:14:19,219
You think I have
nothing to offer but pain.

1053
02:14:19,886 --> 02:14:21,638
Only I know...

1054
02:14:22,973 --> 02:14:24,558
you love pain.

1055
02:14:26,017 --> 02:14:30,063
Pain reminds you
the joy you felt was real.

1056
02:14:32,482 --> 02:14:33,900
More joy, then.

1057
02:14:40,615 --> 02:14:42,075
Do not be afraid.

1058
02:14:57,382 --> 02:14:58,925
<i>An angel</i>

1059
02:15:00,177 --> 02:15:01,344
made again.

1060
02:15:05,891 --> 02:15:07,142
For you.

1061
02:15:41,551 --> 02:15:43,094
Did you miss me?

1062
02:16:01,321 --> 02:16:02,739
Don't you love me?

1063
02:16:22,008 --> 02:16:23,385
Her eyes were green.

1064
02:16:41,194 --> 02:16:42,946
Off-world,

1065
02:16:43,697 --> 02:16:46,366
I have everything I need
to make you talk.

1066
02:16:48,827 --> 02:16:50,704
You do not know
what pain is yet.

1067
02:16:53,081 --> 02:16:54,499
<i>You will learn.</i>

1068
02:17:06,803 --> 02:17:08,722
<i>Hello, handsome.</i>

1069
02:17:25,614 --> 02:17:27,991
<i>What a day, hmm?</i>

1070
02:17:31,870 --> 02:17:33,538
<i>You look lonely.</i>

1071
02:17:34,789 --> 02:17:36,666
<i>I can fix that.</i>

1072
02:17:40,295 --> 02:17:42,714
<i>You look like a good joe.</i>

1073
02:18:18,333 --> 02:18:20,251
<i>Dying for the right cause</i>

1074
02:18:21,169 --> 02:18:23,421
<i>is the most human thing
we can do.</i>

1075
02:18:26,257 --> 02:18:28,760
Because you've never seen
a miracle.

1076
02:19:07,507 --> 02:19:08,675
<i>You're entering</i>

1077
02:19:08,758 --> 02:19:10,468
<i>Los Angeles Airport
restricted airspace.</i>

1078
02:19:10,552 --> 02:19:12,178
<i>Confirm your identity.</i>

1079
02:19:12,345 --> 02:19:15,765
<i>Transport S-14-4-XD.
Confirmed.</i>

1080
02:19:16,683 --> 02:19:20,645
<i>Base, this is
06 outbound departure...</i>

1081
02:19:21,104 --> 02:19:22,397
Where are we going?

1082
02:19:23,857 --> 02:19:25,108
Home.

1083
02:20:20,413 --> 02:20:22,123
<i>Drive two down.</i>

1084
02:20:22,207 --> 02:20:24,042
<i>Backup engaged.</i>

1085
02:20:25,251 --> 02:20:26,377
<i>Warning...</i>

1086
02:20:26,461 --> 02:20:29,005
- Can we make it?
<i>- We're too low.</i>

1087
02:20:29,172 --> 02:20:30,548
Take us back.

1088
02:21:19,806 --> 02:21:20,807
Get us up.

1089
02:21:46,124 --> 02:21:47,292
Open the door.

1090
02:23:40,446 --> 02:23:42,115
I'm the best one.

1091
02:24:23,031 --> 02:24:24,782
Off-world is waiting.

1092
02:26:38,291 --> 02:26:40,460
Joe. Joe!

1093
02:26:50,970 --> 02:26:52,138
Joe!

1094
02:27:31,552 --> 02:27:33,679
You shoulda let me
die out there.

1095
02:27:34,805 --> 02:27:36,057
You did.

1096
02:27:40,186 --> 02:27:41,854
You drowned out there.

1097
02:27:47,652 --> 02:27:49,362
You're free to meet
your daughter now.

1098
02:29:15,239 --> 02:29:17,116
All the best memories
are hers.

1099
02:29:26,834 --> 02:29:27,960
Why?

1100
02:29:30,796 --> 02:29:32,214
Who am I to you?

1101
02:29:41,974 --> 02:29:43,100
Go meet your daughter.

1102
02:29:49,899 --> 02:29:51,317
You okay?

1103
02:32:27,598 --> 02:32:29,099
Just a moment.

1104
02:32:31,644 --> 02:32:33,062
Beautiful, isn't it?
